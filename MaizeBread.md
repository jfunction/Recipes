Maize Bread
============
Adapted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrSAXzyH-8g)

# Ingredients:
## Onion mix:
* 1 small onion (white/brown)
* 80g sundried tomato (perhaps olives would work)
* 1 handful spinach
* 3 sprigs coriander (optional?)
* 1 tbsp chutney/sweet chilli sauce (optional?)
* salt/pepper to taste (optional?)
## Maize mix:
* 1 cup maize meal (White Star Super Maize)
* 1/2 cup boiling water
## Flour mix
* 2 cup cake flour (not self raising)
* 2 tsp instant dry yeast (1 sachet)
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* Spray n Cook (optional)

# Equipment:
* A [bread pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_pan)
* Finely meshed collander for sifting flour.
* Mixing bowl - glass is preferred cos you can see if flour is sticking to the bowl.
* Silicone spatula (optional but useful for mixing)
* a few smaller bowls (optional, useful for preparing stuff before hand)

# Method:
Dice the onion, set aside the (possibly chopped) sundried tomatoes and handful of washed spinach. Get the sweet chilli/chutney and corriander ready if you have some. 

Grab a big (glass) mixing bowl which will hold the bread later. To this, sift the flour through a collander/meshy siev. To that add 2tsp instant dry yeast (1 sachet), 2tsp sugar, 1tsp salt and gently mix in a bit.
You will need 200ml lukewarm water later so measure this out and put next to the bowl so long.

Now's the part where timing is more important. You just need to worry about 2 things: the onion mix and the maizena.

Start heating your pan and when it's medium hot add onions. When they've softened we'll add the tomato, spinach, corriander and chutney. When all the spinach is soft (but not yet slimy I hope) remove from the heat.

In a bowl add 1 cup maizena and 1/2 cup boiling water. Mix in and expect lumps. Set a timer for 10min.

When the maizena and onion mix are ready, take a breath. You now have the onion mix, the maizena mix, the flour bowl and the 200ml water. 

Combine the maizena to the big bowl of floury mix and integrate just a bit before adding the onion mix to the center. Stir and when it gets tough add the 200ml water. Stir until you get a solid piece of dough. 

Now leave the dough in a warm place for up to an hour. When you've done that, line a bread pan with spray n cook/tiny bit of oil and after loosening the dough a bit, transfer into the bread pan.
Preheat the oven to 180, and when that's ready all you need to do is cook for 40-45minutes.

# Notes:
* If you have corriander left over, why not plant some? It's not perrenial though so will eventually stop yielding. Seeds are easy to harvest/replant however.
* I did not use corriander or chutney, the bread still tastes good. 
* Some tomatoes sticking out of the bread got burned in the oven. Maybe I used too many (110g drained, minus a few that I ate).
* I left the bread to rise only 10min, didn't sift my flour and used a bit more oil than I needed. This resulted in my bottom crust being hard and difficult to cut. 
* I purchased sundried tomatoes in olive oil - I used that olive oil to cook with and it imparted a good flavour. I then used the rest of that olive oil to make dinner. Winning!
* Overall the recipe is time-forgiving. Just make sure you add your dry ingredients to the flour first and other deviations should result in a good bread. 
* Probably you have left over spinach. It's great to add to so many things: stir fries, pizzas, soup/stew. Often pairs well with feta.
